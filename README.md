# Part I of Event-Project: "Night of the creative minds 2020 in Cottbus/Germany" (Live Demo 24.10.2020 Stadthalle Cottbus 6:00 - 12:00 pm) -- CANCELD (CORONA)

ar.js and a-frame project with one custom marker for a 3D upgrade of a 2D plan.

This repository contains one working example for augmented reality with ar.js and a-frame. visit https://stefanstoehr.github.io/ar-1/ to start the experiment. In the context of city- and spatial-planning this experiment upgrades a 2d-construction plan with a 3d-model which appears on your mobile-device in realtime, "realscale" and "realperspective".

Okay it's not really in realtime. But the 15 MB .gltf-model behaves slow but behaves on my mobile-device with LTE and 2 of 4 bars. The "realscale" is not really true. It is well known that the scaling is challenging, even though the software-setting for the 3D-model (SketchUp) is in centimeters, and the x- and z-dimension of the models bounding-box fits exactly the size of the marker (around 18 cm x 18 cm).

In the repository are pictures which shows the results. You can clone this repository and use it for your own purpose. 

This ar-experiment was first used in 2019 at "night of creative minds" in Cottbus. It should shows modern tools in the field of city- and spatial- development.
