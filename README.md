# THE LIVING PLAN - SEE WITH SUPERMANS EYES

# Event-Project: "Night of the creative minds 2020 in Cottbus/Germany" (Live Demo 24.10.2020 Stadthalle Cottbus 6:00 - 12:00 pm) 

ar.js and a-frame project with two different custom markers for two different 3d-models.

This repository contains two working examples for augmented reality with ar.js and a-frame. visit https://stewahn.github.io/ndkk2020/ to start the experiment. In the context of city- and spatial-planning this experiment upgrades a 2d-construction plan with a 3d-model which appears on your mobile-device in realtime, realscale and realperspective.
